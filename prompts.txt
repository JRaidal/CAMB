You can use apt get to install gfortran needed to compile the code, and uv to manage python env. You will need to get the forutils submodule code.

This is the camb cosmology code. Currently there are two reionization models implemented. We want to implement a third option, following Eq 1 of

https://arxiv.org/html/2505.15899v1

1. Modify the fortran and python code by close analogy to the implementation of the "exp" reionziation model, making new class for this new reionization model, available from fortran and python.  

2. Add a unit test, similar to the one for the "exp" reionization model

3. Check the changes compile and get to passing text (make sure the test is testing something significant, like the "exp" test)

4. Make a PR (onto the devel branch) with the new implementation with description. Make clear it is AI generated.
